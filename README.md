# First-attempt-to-image-processing
In the project we will try to predict the number using sign language taking the input from the webcam.
The project is done using java and python.

# About The Java Files 
The java files here have the application of first opening the webcam and then taking the border of the image . The program further saves the image as "saved.png".

# About The Python Files
The python file then takes the "saved.png" and compares the images with the given dataset generating a mean result which we compare to get the final output.

# About The Dataset
It is a simple dataset taken from github but grouped and renamed for easy access.

# Note
Setting up OpenCV is required to run this project.Please setup OpenCV in your IDE or the environment.
